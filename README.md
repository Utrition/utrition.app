# UTrition Website v2.0

## 07.11.2024 Changes
I started by attempting to repliace the basic layout of Sydney's mockup, and added some styling to get close to what we wanted since I don't have details like fonts, stock images, etc. I also made it responsive to mobile.

Here's a screenshot of what I ended up with for the hero statistics sections:

### Unstyled Sections
The basic layout for the rest of the site is essentially implemented, but the styling and content is yet to come. Here's a few screenshots of what I have so far:

#### Solution + B2C Sections
